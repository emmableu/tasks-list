Mo have completed all other the requirements of the project, except one: 
- When the last clone of the enemy is destroyed, show the winning banner (see the whole project demo at the top of the page)

What number should replace the ??? block in his code for the enemy sprite? (The bullet and player part of the code is completed already, so they are hidden.)
